# Slingshot Simulator

### About the Program
---
* A grid of squares is created, which are then coloured in to map our the parabola of a slingshot
* Values such as angle, velocity and distance exist, which are determined by an arbitrary "benchmark" speed that is extrapolated
* The angle value is calculated as the angle of elevation of the shot, given the initial "wind up" angle of depression
* This program runs entirely on Javascript, with the help of jQuery

### How to Use
---
* Hover over and click a square to the left of the slingshot to wind up and shoot the slingshot
* Click "New Shot" to try again, either with or without "Erase Previous Shots" checked to keep a history
